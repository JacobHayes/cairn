//! The in-browser root (ARCHITECTURE, Service layer and composition; Web UI: in-browser
//! host): the browser host's composition root. The same service as the server's, over the
//! memory store seeded from the fixtures on every load, with the in-process notifier, one
//! local identity, and no assistant, MCP, or SSE. Nothing persists and each page is its own.
//!
//! Its answers are the API's JSON for the same operations (a patch answer, a journey page,
//! a revision tick), so a data layer reads either host with one set of types. The memory
//! store answers at once, so each operation runs to completion synchronously; a subscriber
//! takes its ticks when its host's loop asks, as the SSE stream does on the server.
