//! The HTTP API (ARCHITECTURE, HTTP API): axum endpoints over the service under `/api`,
//! behind the auth layer, for every operation the service offers (I1), and `GET /healthz`
//! outside it. A rejected patch answers its rejection unchanged (A15); every request is held
//! to the request limits and observed (ARCHITECTURE, Observability). Every other path on the
//! origin is the host's web app ([`router_beside`]).
//!
//! [`router`] is the whole API as an `axum::Router`, so the binary and a testbed serve it on
//! whatever runtime they build
//! (decisions/2026-10-06-6-1-drives-the-real-http-server-on-one-current-thread.md). A TCP
//! server records peers, as the auth layer needs: `axum::serve(listener,
//! router.into_make_service_with_connect_info::<SocketAddr>())`.
