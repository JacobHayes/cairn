//! The embedded web build (ARCHITECTURE, Build, run, deploy): the app's Vite build, with
//! the wasm module, built by `mise run build:web` before `cargo build` into
//! `web/app/dist/build/` (never checked in) and embedded with `rust-embed`. Each file is
//! served at its own path, and `index.html` at `/` and at every other path the server does
//! not keep, since the UI routes by path: a screen's address loads the page, which shows
//! that screen (decisions/2026-10-08-the-api-is-served-under-api-and-the-app-owns-the-rest.md).
//!
//! A binary built without the web build embeds nothing, and `cairn serve` refuses to start
//! rather than serve an API with no UI ([`router`]).
