# Running Cairn

How to run your own Cairn: the binary, its configuration, and how to put it in front of
people. For trying it on your own machine, see the [README](../README.md#try-it).

## The binary

`cairn` is one binary: `cairn serve` runs the HTTP API, the MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`,
the revision stream, the assistant when one is configured, and the web UI on one port, over
one database file. The API, MCP, metrics, and sign-in live under `/api/`; OAuth metadata
under `/.well-known/` and the health check at `/healthz` sit beside it; every other path is
the web UI, so a screen's address (`/journeys/<id>`) loads directly. Build it with
`mise run build` (the web build is embedded; a binary built without it refuses to serve).
The other commands: `cairn migrate` creates the database or brings its schema up to date,
`cairn config check` validates a configuration (providers included) without opening
anything, and `cairn version`. `cairn demo` serves sample journeys from memory with no
configuration, for trying Cairn out, never for a deployment.

## Configuration

The configuration is a TOML file, passed as `--config FILE` or named by `CAIRN_CONFIG`.
Nothing a deployment must choose has a default; `cairn.dev.toml` is a complete example:

```toml
database = "/var/lib/cairn/cairn.db"     # relative paths are relative to this file
listen = "127.0.0.1:8080"
public_url = "https://cairn.example.com/" # links, OAuth redirects, and the Host served
timezone = "America/New_York"            # what "today" is, for everyone

[rank]                                   # optional: the PRD's defaults otherwise
urgency = 0.40
late = 0.15
gravity = 0.25
unlocks = 0.20
horizon_days = 14
undecided_discount = 0.5
other_owner_factor = 2.0

[[auth]]                                 # one or more, asked in this order
kind = "oidc"                            # or dev, builtin_oauth, tailscale, gcp_iap
name = "sso"
issuer = "https://login.example.com"
client_id = "cairn"
auto_link = true

[[auth]]
kind = "builtin_oauth"                   # MCP clients and agent tokens
name = "agents"
sign_in_with = "sso"

[assistant]                              # optional: the in-app assistant
protocol = "anthropic_messages"          # or openai_responses, chat_completions
endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
model = "a-model-name"
```

Each provider kind's settings: `dev` (`user`, `verified_emails`, `token`, `auto_link`,
`allow_off_loopback`), `oidc` (`issuer`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `auto_link`),
`builtin_oauth` (`sign_in_with`), `tailscale` (`mode` direct with `socket`, or proxy, with
`trusted_proxies` listing the addresses or networks of a proxy on another machine, or left
out for `tailscale serve` on this one; `auto_link`), `gcp_iap` (`audience`, the
IAP-protected backend service as `/projects/<number>/global/backendServices/<id>`;
`auto_link`). Behind Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy, `gcp_iap` verifies the signed
assertion IAP adds to every request (`x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion`) against Google's keys, so
each person is signed in as their Google account with no sign-in step of Cairn's own.

The environment overrides `database`, `listen`, `public_url`, and `timezone` with
`CAIRN_DATABASE`, `CAIRN_LISTEN`, `CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL`, and `CAIRN_TIMEZONE`, and supplies
secrets: `CAIRN_ASSISTANT_API_KEY`, and `CAIRN_AUTH_<NAME>_TOKEN` (dev) or
`CAIRN_AUTH_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` (OIDC), `<NAME>` being the provider's name in capitals
with `-` as `_`.

## Behind a proxy

Cairn serves plain HTTP. TLS termination, process supervision, and containers are left to
what runs it: put it behind a proxy that terminates TLS and forwards the `Host` header, and
set `public_url` to the address people use. Requests naming any other host are refused
(421), as are loopback names unless the listener is bound to loopback. `GET /healthz` needs
no credential, for the proxy's health check: it answers 200 while the server is serving and
503 once its database has failed closed, when the process also exits non-zero for its
supervisor to restart. Logs are JSON lines on standard error; metrics are at `/api/metrics`
in Prometheus's format, behind the same auth as the API (a scraper uses an agent token). An OIDC provider's redirect URI is
`<public_url>api/auth/<name>/callback`.

## Upgrades and backups

A process that opens the database holds it exclusively, so `cairn serve` and `cairn migrate`
never share one: run against a live server, `migrate` fails with a locking error. The server
applies any migrations the database lacks when it starts. To upgrade, stop the server, run
`cairn migrate` with the new binary (a failed migration then shows before anything serves),
and start it again.

There is no online backup: stop the server, copy the database file together with the two
files the store keeps beside it, its log and its write-ahead log, and start it again;
restore all three together. For `cairn.db` those are `cairn.db-log` and `cairn.db-wal` (the
log takes the database's name with its extension set to `.db-log`, so `data.sqlite` keeps
`data.db-log` and `data.sqlite-wal`). Committed writes sit in the log until the store
checkpoints them into the database file, so that file alone is not a backup. Do not open
the database with another SQLite tool while Cairn runs.
