# Cairn

Cairn structures a process as one graph of nodes that must be decided or done: decisions,
deliverables, actions, milestones, and groups. A route is the reusable template; a journey is
a live graph with answers, progress, people, and dates. Every change is a validated, atomic
patch, and Cairn ranks the frontier to answer "what should I do next?". People use it through
a web UI; agents use the same capabilities through an HTTP API and an MCP server.

Cairn was built in feature briefs, all landed. The binary runs: `mise run serve` starts a local
deployment at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

## Built with

[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) (xyflow, MIT) draws the graph, [ELK](https://eclipse.dev/elk/) lays it out, and the fonts are Space Grotesk and IBM Plex (SIL OFL 1.1). The graph's attribution badge is hidden, as React Flow's licence allows; xyflow asks organizations that hide it in commercial use to subscribe to [React Flow Pro](https://reactflow.dev/pro) or [sponsor the project](https://github.com/sponsors/xyflow), and a deployment that does is following its request.

## Develop

Tools are pinned in `mise.toml`; tasks live in `mise-tasks/`.

```sh
mise install          # pinned Rust toolchain, Node, wasm tool, and cargo-patina
mise run check        # every rung of the validation ladder that exists
mise run check:fast   # rungs 1 to 3: the inner loop
mise run check:1      # one rung
mise run gen          # regenerate the generated paths
mise run sim          # simulation campaigns under patina; not part of check
mise run build        # the release binary, with the web build embedded
mise run serve        # a local deployment from cairn.dev.toml, signed in as the dev user
```

## Run

`cairn` is one binary: `cairn serve` runs the HTTP API, the MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`,
the revision stream, the assistant when one is configured, and the web UI on one port, over
one database file. The API, MCP, metrics, and sign-in live under `/api/`; OAuth metadata
under `/.well-known/` and the health check at `/healthz` sit beside it; every other path is
the web UI, so a screen's address (`/journeys/<id>`) loads directly. Build it with
`mise run build` (the web build is embedded; a binary built without it refuses to serve).
The other commands: `cairn migrate` creates the database or brings its schema up to date,
`cairn config check` validates a configuration (providers included) without opening
anything, and `cairn version`.

The configuration is a TOML file, passed as `--config FILE` or named by `CAIRN_CONFIG`.
Nothing a deployment must choose has a default; `cairn.dev.toml` is a complete example:

```toml
database = "/var/lib/cairn/cairn.db"     # relative paths are relative to this file
listen = "127.0.0.1:8080"
public_url = "https://cairn.example.com/" # links, OAuth redirects, and the Host served
timezone = "America/New_York"            # A9: "today" for everyone

[rank]                                   # optional: the PRD's defaults otherwise
urgency = 0.40
late = 0.15
gravity = 0.25
leverage = 0.20
horizon_days = 14
undecided_discount = 0.5
other_owner_factor = 2.0

[[auth]]                                 # one or more, asked in this order
kind = "oidc"                            # or dev, builtin_oauth, tailscale, gcp_iap
name = "corp"
issuer = "https://login.example.com"
client_id = "cairn"
auto_link = true

[[auth]]
kind = "builtin_oauth"                   # MCP clients and agent tokens
name = "agents"
sign_in_with = "corp"

[assistant]                              # optional (I5)
protocol = "anthropic_messages"          # or openai_responses, chat_completions
endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
model = "a-model-name"
```

Each provider kind's settings: `dev` (`user`, `verified_emails`, `token`, `auto_link`,
`allow_off_loopback`), `oidc` (`issuer`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `auto_link`),
`builtin_oauth` (`sign_in_with`), `tailscale` (`mode` direct with `socket`, or proxy, with
`trusted_proxies` listing the addresses or networks of a proxy on another machine, or left
out for `tailscale serve` on this one; `auto_link`), `gcp_iap` (`audience`, the IAP-protected backend service as
`/projects/<number>/global/backendServices/<id>`; `auto_link`). Behind Google Cloud
Identity-Aware Proxy, `gcp_iap` verifies the signed assertion IAP adds to every request
(`x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion`) against Google's keys, so each person is signed in as their
Google account with no sign-in step of Cairn's own. The environment overrides `database`, `listen`, `public_url`, and `timezone`
with `CAIRN_DATABASE`, `CAIRN_LISTEN`, `CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL`, and `CAIRN_TIMEZONE`, and supplies
secrets: `CAIRN_ASSISTANT_API_KEY`, and `CAIRN_AUTH_<NAME>_TOKEN` (dev) or
`CAIRN_AUTH_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` (OIDC), `<NAME>` being the provider's name in capitals
with `-` as `_`.

Cairn serves plain HTTP. TLS termination, process supervision, and containers are left to
what runs it: put it behind a proxy that terminates TLS and forwards the `Host` header, and
set `public_url` to the address people use. Requests naming any other host are refused
(421), as are loopback names unless the listener is bound to loopback. `GET /healthz` needs
no credential, for the proxy's health check: it answers 200 while the server is serving and
503 once its database has failed closed (restart the process). Logs are JSON lines on
standard error; metrics are at `/api/metrics` in Prometheus's format, behind the same auth
as the API (a scraper uses an agent token). An OIDC provider's redirect URI is
`<public_url>api/auth/<name>/callback`.

A process that opens the database holds it exclusively, so `cairn serve` and `cairn migrate`
never share one: run against a live server, `migrate` fails with a locking error. The server
applies any migrations the database lacks when it starts. To upgrade, stop the server, run
`cairn migrate` with the new binary (a failed migration then shows before anything serves),
and start it again. There is no online backup: stop the server, copy the database file
together with the two files the store keeps beside it, its log and its write-ahead log, and
start it again; restore all three together. For `cairn.db` those are `cairn.db-log` and
`cairn.db-wal` (the log takes the database's name with its extension set to `.db-log`, so
`data.sqlite` keeps `data.db-log` and `data.sqlite-wal`). Committed writes sit in the log
until the store checkpoints them into the database file, so that file alone is not a
backup. Do not open the database with another SQLite tool while Cairn runs.

CI (`.github/workflows/check.yml`) runs `mise run check` on every push and nightly, and
`mise run sim` nightly outside the gate.
